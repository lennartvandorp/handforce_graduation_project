<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
Strokes are common and cause a lot of hardship for thousands of people throughout the Netherlands. They can have significant and long lasting impacts on a victim’s brain, their mental capacities and their motor functions. The purpose of this report is focused on the latter. For the lack of motor functions exist numerous different therapies. A patient would for example pick up and move a cube from one place to another. The patients are required to repeat this monotonous movement often. This is the cause of one of two main problems with this therapy that could be solved by the project described in this paper. It can be tough and boring for a patient to regularly practice their motor functions without being mentally stimulated. The second problem is that therapists do not get a proper insight into the progression of patients. They only see their progress whenever they have a session together. Being able to track more specific data could provide significant improvements in the effectiveness of treatment.
To solve these two problems, the Handforce project has been set up. Handforce consists of a number of schools, companies and organizations working together and sharing knowledge to use currently available technology to increase the quality of hand rehabilitation after a stroke. Some of the technologies they aim to use are serious games and Virtual Reality. (VR) Serious games are powerful tools that could help alleviate the problem of monotony in current therapies. Virtual reality’s immersive qualities also have the ability to provide the therapy with even more advantages that traditional motor therapy does not have. The fact that VR feels so much like being in a different space means that is has a very strong neurological effect on the user. This neurological effect could be used to the advantage of the therapy. 
This report is provided by MaMa Producties, a small Virtual Reality and design company in Eindhoven. The role of MaMa Producties is to create a game using Virtual Reality which helps solve the two main issues with current hand therapy. Two groups in the Handforce project are working on custom controllers that are meant to provide therapeutic advantages while controlling a video game. To help rehabilitate the strength and coordination of the patients in a fun and engaging way. While providing more advantages to the therapists and the patients themselves. </p>
