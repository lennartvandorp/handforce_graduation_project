<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
In the Netherlands, there are thousands of people who need rehabilitation in the aftermath of a stroke. This often involves poor strength and coordination in one side of their body. At the moment, the exercises these people have to perform are simple and repetitive. It might consist of moving around a cube to practise coordination. However, video games and Virtual Reality are powerful media that allow people to imagine themselves in another world, to have more motivation to keep going and much more. Would it be possible, in collaboration with physiotherapists and hardware engineers, to develop a therapy that takes advantage of these benefits? What strategies can be learned from? 
This project explores the answers to these questions, as well as documenting the process of creating a video game to help the rehabilitation process of a patient’s hand after a stroke. 
Through analysing sources a number of inspirational ideas emerged. Eight principles of other therapies are explained along with how they might be used in a serious game, VR or not, for this purpose. Two of these principles; increasing difficulty and multisensory stimulation are highlighted as especially applicable within the current context. 
The most important takeaway from these analyses is that visual feedback to the patient’s actions is an effective tool for rehabilitation while that is also easily applicable in the context of a video game. 
Motion sickness is a common side effect of the use of Virtual Reality. Therefore, it is important to understand the causes of motion sickness and ways of avoiding their effects. The two strongest causes of motion sickness are found to be, firstly, a disconnect between signals of the player’s visual centre and their balance organ and, secondly, a stressful environment. This knowledge has be used to make sure the final product would not cause strong motion sickness. 
The eventual product is a video game that can be played in both VR or on a traditional flat screen. The player will control the game using a custom controller that is designed to train the strength of the user’s fingers. The game is a three lane runner comparable to games like Subway Surfers, where the player character rides a bicycle through the calm environment of the Dutch countryside.
